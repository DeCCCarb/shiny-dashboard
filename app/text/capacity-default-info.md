### Floating Offshore Wind

The California Energy Commission’s Strategic Plan for Offshore Wind has established a statewide goal of 25 GW of floating offshore wind capacity by 2045. This capacity will be split between two regions slated for offshore wind development, two projects in Humboldt Bay and three in the Central Coast. In this analysis, the 25 GW capacity is split between these two sites based on the proposed projects, estimating that 60%, or 15 GW capacity by 2045, would be the Central Coast’s contribution to this goal.
