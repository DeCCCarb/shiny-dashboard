### Oil well capping is essential work to further the clean energy transition
Idle wells pose health risks and environmental hazards, emitting pollutants long after production ends. This work is vital to eliminating these public health risks and methane emissions posed by idle wells. This analysis calculates projected job growth to cap all active and idle crude oil wells by 2045, assuming that **4 FTE jobs** will be required starting in 2025.

There is much potential for *environmental health and safety advisors, decommissioning engineers, project management, planning engineers, and other capping technicians* as capping ramps up. Job opportunities are not limited to these roles, and approximately **1,400 total FTE jobs** would be created in the tricounty region.
