# Welcome to the Labor Impact Explorer for the California Central Coast!
<br>
The goal of this dashboard is to help labor advocates, community organizers, and people like you to understand the impacts of the clean energy transition on the Central Coast!
<br>
<br>
California is at the forefront of the clean energy transition. The development of clean energy on the Central Coast is crucial for creating a greener, safer world. It is our hope that our estimates of where, how many, and what type of energy jobs will be gained (and lost) during this transition will inform conversations and policy decisions around offshore wind installation and the community investment funding.

Our analysis has pointed us to these technologies for job development:
- Floating Offshore Wind
- Land Based Wind
- Rooftop and Utility Solar
- Oil Well Capping

However, there are many other technologies that will be essential for the creation of the clean economy, that have been excluded from our analysis. Some of these technologies are:
- battery storage
- geothermal
- 
If you are interested in replicating our analysis for a different technology, please reach out to us.
